# cyclingnews-tdf-live
The Cyclingnews Tour de France live coverage (http://live.cyclingnews.com/) is awesome.  I am also a developer,
spend most of my time in a terminal, and I love CLI tools.

So this is a little CLI client to pull the Cyclingnews live coverage feed into a terminal window.

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (v0.12.6 preferred)

## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leightonshank/cyclingnews-tdf-live.git
$ cd cyclingnews-tdf-live
$ npm install
$ bin/tdflive
```

## Credits
Thanks to [Cyclingnews](http://www.cyclingnews.com/) for their awesome live coverage!
